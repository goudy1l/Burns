What are burns?

Burns are one of the most common household injuries, especially among children. The term “burn” means more than the burning sensation associated with this injury. Burns are characterized by severe skin damage that causes the affected skin cells to die.

Most people can recover from burns without serious health consequences, depending on the cause and degree of injury. More serious burns require immediate emergency medical care to prevent complications and death.

Burn levels
There are three primary types of burns: first-, second-, and third-degree. Each degree is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first-degree being the most minor and third-degree being the most severe. Damage includes:

first-degree burns: red, nonblistered skin
second-degree burns: blisters and some thickening of the skin
third-degree burns: widespread thickness with a white, leathery appearance
There are also fourth-degree burns. This type of burn includes all of the symptoms of a third-degree burn and also extends beyond the skin into tendons and bones.

Burns have a variety of causes, including:

scalding from hot, boiling liquids
chemical burns
electrical burns
fires, including flames from matches, candles, and lighters
excessive sun exposure
The type of burn is not based on the cause of it. Scalding, for example, can cause all three burns, depending on how hot the liquid is and how long it stays in contact with the skin.

Chemical and electrical burns warrant immediate medical attention because they can affect the inside of the body, even if skin damage is minor.

First-degree burn
First-degree burns cause minimal skin damage. They are also called “superficial burns” because they affect the outermost layer of skin. Signs of a first-degree burn include:

redness
minor inflammation, or swelling
pain
dry, peeling skin occurs as the burn heals
Since this burn affects the top layer of skin, the signs and symptoms disappear once the skin cells shed. First-degree burns usually heal within 7 to 10 days without scarring.

You should still see your doctor if the burn affects a large area of skin, more than three inches, and if it’s on your face or a major joint, which include:

knee
ankle
foot
spine
shoulder
elbow
forearm
First-degree burns are usually treated with home care. Healing time may be quicker the sooner you treat the burn. Treatments for a first-degree burn include:

soaking the wound in cool water for five minutes or longer
taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief
applying lidocaine (an anesthetic) with aloe vera gel or cream to soothe the skin
using an antibiotic ointment and loose gauze to protect the affected area
Make sure you don’t use ice, as this may make the damage worse. Never apply cotton balls to a burn because the small fibers can stick to the injury and increase the risk of infection. Also, avoid home remedies like butter and eggs as these are not proven to be effective.
